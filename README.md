## Giga Inventory Mod

This Mod expands the stash, cube, and inventory of a character

It is based on the Extended Stash Mod (from [The Phrozen Keep](https://d2mods.info/home.php))  
and increases character inventory from a 4x10 grid to a 9x10 grid

### Installation

1. Make a backup of your chatacters and the data directory (if it exists)

2. Copy the included data directory into the Diablo II game directory

3. Create a shortcut for the Diablo II executable and add the parameters "-direct -txt"

4. Start the game with this shortcut and enjoy the largest Diablo 2 inventory

### Warning

Items in the increased part of the inventory will be lost if the  
character is used in a game with the standard inventory size
